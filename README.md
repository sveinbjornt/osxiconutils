`osxiconutils` is a suite of Mac command line utilities to get or set Mac OS X file icons, and convert to and from Apple's `icns` icon file format. Created a long time ago.

The suite contains the following tools:

* **seticon** - set the custom icon of a Mac OS X file or folder [<a href="https://sveinbjorn.org/files/manpages/seticon.man.html">man page</a>]

* **geticon** - retrieve the icon of a given Mac OS X file or folder as an `icns` file [<a href="https://sveinbjorn.org/files/manpages/geticon.man.html">man page</a>]

* **image2icns** - convert an image file to a Mac OS X `icns` file [<a href="https://sveinbjorn.org/files/manpages/image2icns.man.html">man page</a>]

* **icns2image** - convert a Mac OS X `icns` file to a standard image file (JPEG, PNG etc.) [<a href="https://sveinbjorn.org/files/manpages/icns2image.man.html">man page</a>]
